For your Products \& Services page (especially for a uPVC panel company), the goal is to make it clear, visual, and easy to compare — so visitors can quickly find what they need and then either request a quote or contact you.



Here’s the ideal structure:



1️⃣ Hero Section (First Impression)

Headline:

Example: “Premium uPVC Panels \& Professional Installation Services”



Short subtext:

“From stylish wall panels to durable ceilings, we offer complete uPVC solutions for homes and businesses.”



Visual: High-quality image or collage of your top products in real installations.



2️⃣ Product Categories (Main Showcase)

Break products into clear, clickable sections — each with an image, short description, and “View Details” button:

uPVC Ceiling Panels – Moisture-resistant, lightweight designs.



Decorative uPVC Panels – Custom colors, patterns, and textures.

💡 Tip: Each category should link to a dedicated product detail page for SEO and better conversion.

Product name \& type



Key features \& benefits (bullet points)



Specifications (size, thickness, finish options, warranty)



Images from different angles



Applications (Residential, Commercial, Outdoor, etc.)

Custom Fabrication – Tailored sizes, finishes, and designs.



Bulk Supply / Wholesale – For builders, architects, and resellers.

Portfolio Page Structure

Here’s how I’d recommend setting it up:



1️⃣ Hero / Intro Section (Top)

Short title: “Our Projects” or “Portfolio”



Subtext:

Example: “A showcase of our completed uPVC panel installations for homes, offices, and commercial spaces across Nepal.”



Optional filter bar:



All | Residential | Commercial | Custom Designs



2️⃣ Masonry / Pinterest-Style Grid

Images of projects in different aspect ratios for a natural look.



Hover effect:



Slight zoom-in



Overlay with project title/location/category



Each tile clickable → opens a lightbox (pop-up).



3️⃣ Image Pop-Up / Lightbox

Enlarged high-quality image.



Close button (X) in top corner.



Arrow navigation (← →) to browse without closing.



Optional: Caption with project name, location, materials used.



4️⃣ Optional Load More / Infinite Scroll

Instead of pagination, new images load when scrolling down.



Keeps users engaged without breaking flow.



5️⃣ Call-to-Action (Bottom)

“Like what you see? Let’s start your project today!”



Button: Get a Quote



💡 Extra Tip:

If you make the images clickable to detailed project pages instead of just a lightbox, you can improve SEO by having:



Before \& after photos



Short write-ups about each project



Keywords like “uPVC wall panels in Kathmandu”



That way, you get both a visual impact and search engine benefits.



If you want, I can give you two layout options for the portfolio:



High-speed version (only lightbox pop-ups, no separate pages)



SEO-friendly version (each project has its own page)



That way you can choose based on whether you want faster browsing or better Google rankings.
